# JavaScript_Calculator
An Awesome Calculator build using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript with  dark mode feature.
Basically The Calculator is a portable device used in our day life to perform various mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, etc. However, we have scientific or sophisticated calculators used to solve complex tasks such as trigonometry functions, degrees, exponential operators, log functions, hyperbolic functions, square root, and so on. 
In this project we crate a JavaScript Calculator using the JavaScript, HTML and CSS programming languages.
